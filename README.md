Code (JAGS and NIMBLE) and example data for implementing hierarchical spatial capture-recapture models

The original analysis was completed with the JAGS code. As of early 2020, this code is not compiling, apparently due to changes in JAGS. I haven't had to time work out how to fix it.  

The NIMBLE version of the code (written by Nathan Hostetter) does compile and run efficiently.
