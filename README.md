Code (JAGS and NIMBLE) and example data for implementing hierarchical spatial capture-recapture models

The original analysis was completed with the JAGS code. As of early 2020, this code is not compiling however, apparently due to changes in JAGS. 

The NIMBLE version of the code (written by Nathan Hostetter) does compile and run efficiently.
